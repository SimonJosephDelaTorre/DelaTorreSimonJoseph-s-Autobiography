                <p>I'm Simon Joseph P. Dela Torre. I'm currently studying at Taguig City University with the program of Bachelor of Science in Information Systems. 
                    I lived in the Philippines specifically, in Taguig City, Baranggay Pinagsama, Upperwest Village.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, back then, when I was in senior high school at Western Bicutan National High School, during Grade 11, 
                    I was a consistent Honor Student in our class up until Grade 12 in the strand of Electrical Installation and Maintenance.
                    With that reason, I have knowledge about electrical things as well as I have some basic electrical skills. 
                    Also, some of my favorite things to do are to watch movies and series, play guitar, sing, as well as play different kinds of online games with my friends, as of now the game that I'm playing the most is Valorant. 
                    Additionally, I also love traveling and exploring different places. One of my dreams, since I was a child, is to travel across different countries such as Israel, Greece, South Korea, and many more. 
                    Finally, one of my greatest desires ever since I was a child is that our family bond and relationship will stay and last forever.</p>

                <p>A brief trivia about our family. We're 6 in the famliy and I have 3 siblings. 
                    Additionally, our family has a little bit foreign blood, I found out when I was just 10 years old. 
                    That time my Mother told us that her Grandfather is a pure Filipino, but her Grandmother was a pure Chinese and her Grandmother's name was Pau Lin while my Mom's Mother which name was Celsa is one half Chinese. 
                    So basically it means my Mom got some Chinese blood from her mother and according to her she has one fourth Chinese blood. 
                    And we as my Mother's children, she said that we only have one eight Chinese blood. 
                    However my Father is just a pure Filipino, but I think his ancestors came from Spain and has Spanish blood. 
                    Because our surname is "Dela Torre," and when I searched our surname in Google. 
                    It says that it is a Spanish word and most of the people that has that surname usually came from Spain. 
                    That's why I think my Father has some Spanish blood. But his ancestors which I believe has a Spanish blood was way too far to be related to us.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, my family loves to have get togethers like having summer trips. 
                    But besides on that every sunday me and my family always attends church service in Victory Fort Bonifacio when the pandemic didn't striked yet. 
                    Being part of a Christian family, I really want to have a stronger personal relationship with God. 
                    I'm blessed to be part of a Christian family, and one of my desires was to have confidence to share the Gospel or the word of God to other people, to encourage more people to accept Christ as their Lord and Saviour.</p>
                <p>Moreover, my family is the most significant thing in my life. 
                    Since they gave guidance in all areas of my development as a teen. 
                    Also, advices from my parents are always available no matter what time I need it thus, it helps me in the direction of my life. 
                    I can also feel their love, care, and support. 
                    We also share the moments of joy, laughters, fun, and even sadness and tears.</p>
