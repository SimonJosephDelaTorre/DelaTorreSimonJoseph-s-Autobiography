            Everytime there's an event like birthday or holidays such as christmas and new year. All of them help on another in cooking. 
            Their dishes was not just common foods that we see during Filipino occasions, some of those are more innovative and creative dishes. 
            Back then, our family owns a karinderya, now I want to have a much better business which is more developed and improved type of food business which is a restaurant or a small cafe. 
            I want it to be black colored themed with a minimalist style and design.</font></td></tr>

            Next is, Singapore which also an Asian country. They have impressive building structures that I want to see in person including their shopping malls. 
            Thrid one is Los Angeles USA. The reason I want to travel in this specific country is because I visit the santa monica beach as well as the Hollywood boulevard. 
            Fourth is Israel, my father was already been here since he works in this country as an OFW until now. 
            But I still want to travel there with him to see those holy places and interesting stories of every spot. 
            Finally, not the last one since I want to travel to many countries, but these are the ones I most prefer. 
            So the fifth one is Greece, I really love to see their stunning lagoons and excellent structures of their buildings and houses which is worth to see.</font></td></tr>

            1. When I was a child I didn't really think or dream much about to be a seafarer. 
            However, when I heard from my father that it is also his dream, but unfortunately he didn't pursue it and finish a different course. 
            So I'm encouraged by him to be a seaman, as well as when I became more matured I realized how interesting and challenging to be a seafarer.</font></td></tr>
